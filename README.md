# data_analytics_project
## Repository for the data analytics project in uni on how to improve sustainable mobility

## About
The analysis is probably not going to be representative due to the data being based on surveys/polls.

The surveys/polls are going to be done in our data analytics class, among people we know aswell as an open survey to get as much different data as possible.

The data received will be the foundation for an analysis for our project in the data analytics class for the purpose of finding out how sustainable mobility can be improved and what factors are currently obstacles for people in using e-mobility, public transportation and similar methods for daily commute.
